Analysis of Betfair's dataset of all betting transactions during the 2015 Cricket World Cup

## Overview
- Betfair provided the participants of Melbourne's first ['Datathon'](http://datathon.zusedigital.com/) with a datset containing all the betting transactions conducted during the 2015 Cricket World Cup (~4 million transactions in total). 
- The goal was to formulate questions of interest and answer them using predictive models.
- As the datset itself is not public, this repository only contains (some of the) analysis code, figures and a slidedeck used for the presentation of results.
